# Task Tracker

[DEMO](https://task-tracker-z.netlify.app/)<br /><br />
In the beginning, this app was conceived as a simple to-do application.As my knowledge of JavaScript grew, I added new features, such as weather forecast, map, and displaying tasks by day.<br /><br />
Although I already had the entire application written and working properly using traditional programming methods, I decided to restructure the code to adopt the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and thus practice classes and object-oriented programming while also separating concerns between data, presentation, and application logic.<br /><br />
