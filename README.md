# Task Tracker

[DEMO](https://task-tracker-z.netlify.app/)<br /><br />
In the beginning, this app was conceived as a simple to-do application.As my knowledge of JavaScript grew, I added new features, such as weather forecast, map, and displaying tasks by day.Although I already had the entire application written and working properly, I decided to restructure the code, that is, to write it completely from scratch, and thus practice classes and object-oriented programming.<br />
